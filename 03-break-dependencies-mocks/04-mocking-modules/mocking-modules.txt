Mocking Modules
---------------
- Open the file mocking.js (src/libs/moacking.js)
    - In the function getPriceCurrency()
        - It calls for the function getExchangeRate() (defined in currency.js)
            - Current implementation returns a random number using Math.random()
            - This makes tests untrustworthy as the return value changes after every execution

        - Replace the real function getExchangeRate() with a Mock function
            - That returns a particular exchange rate instead of a random value

            - Define the Mock function OUTSIDE the test case
                - Use "vi.mock()"
                - Pass the relative path of the file that contains the real function               
                - Vitest replaces EVERY exported function from this module with a Mock function

                - NOTE: This line gets executed FIRST despite the presence of import statements
                    - In JavaScript, this is referred as "hoisting"

            - To execute the Mock function
                - Pass it as an argument value to vi.mocked()
                - Then attach the corresponding method (e.g. .mockReturnValue()) after it
