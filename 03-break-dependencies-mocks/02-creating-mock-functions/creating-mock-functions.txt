Creating Mock Functions
-----------------------
- A Mock function is a function that imitates the behavior of a real function
    - It is used to test a unit (function) in isolation


- The Vitest has an object "vi" along with the method .fn()
    - That creates / returns a mock function


- The instantiated "vi" object comes with the following methods
    - .mockReturnValue()    = Program a mock function to return a value
    - .mockResolvedValue()  = Program a mock function to aeturn a promise
    - .mockImplementation   = Provide implementation (of logic) to a mock function


- Also came with Matchers to write assertions for a mock function
    - .toHaveBeenCalled()       = Checks if the mock function has been called
    - .toHaveBeenCalledWith()   = Checks if the mocked function is called w/ a matching argument value
    - .toHaveBeenCalledOnce()   = Checks if the mock function is called onced
