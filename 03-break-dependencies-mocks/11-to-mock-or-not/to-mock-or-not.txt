To Mock or Not To Mock
----------------------
- Mock functions allows us to break dependences and test functions in isolation


- The problem with using Mock functions
    - A test suite become dependent on the Mock function's implementation
    
    - This also violates the principle behind
        - Test the "what" (a mock function do)
        - NOT the "how" (a mock function is implemented)

    - If a test know how a Mock funcion is implemented
        - The test can break once the implementation has been changed

    - Avoid oversuing Mock functions


- Use Mock function ONLY for mocking external dependences 
    - e.g. database, API or any services
        - Services that may NOT be available or slow to work with during test execution
