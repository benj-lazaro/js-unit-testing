Spying on Functions
-------------------
- Monitors the behavior of functions during test execution
    - Using "vi.spyOn()"

    - Pass argument values
        - 1st paramter  =   an object
        - 2nd paramter  =   a string that represents a method w/in the (aformentioned) object

    - Returns a "spy" object
        - It is similar to a mock (function) object
