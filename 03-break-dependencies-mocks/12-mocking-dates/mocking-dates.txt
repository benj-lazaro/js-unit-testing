Mocking Dates
-------------
- Trustworthy tests
    - Are deterministic
        - They produce the same result every single time
        - If a test pass, it should ALWAYS pass
        - If a test fail, it should ALWAYS fail

    - Are NOT dependent on any random data
    - Are NOT dependent on current date/time
    - Are NOT dependent on global or shared state


- Write a test suite and cases for the isOnline() function
    - Create a Mock function for the dependency on the current system date/time
    
    - Use Vitest's built-in function setSystemTime()
        - Accepts date/time as a string, as a number or as a Date object
