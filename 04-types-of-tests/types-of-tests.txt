Types of Tests
--------------
- In automated testing, there are 3 types of tests:
    - Unit
        - This focuses on the correctness of individual components (units) of an application in isolation
            - These includes classes, functions & small modules

        - They are incredably useful in catching bugs early during the development process
        - They are incredably fast to write and provide immediate feedback

    - Integration
        - This focuses on how different units of an application work together as a whole
        - They help identify bugs that may arise when combining different units together

    - End-to-End (E2E)
        - This focuses on testing the application as a whole
        - They simulate user interaction with the entire system
            - From the user interface (UI) down to the backend services 

        - They are excellent in ensuring that the application works seamlessly from the user's perspective


- What types of test to write?
    - Write more Unit tests than Integration tests 
    - Write more Integration tests than E2E tests

    - This is referred to as the "Testing Pyramid"
        - This is a suggestion, NOT to be followed religiously
        - Every application is different
        - There is NO "one-size-fits-all" in software engineering

    - As tests progresses towards the top of the Testing Pyramid
        - Speed of the tests will be slower
        - BUT confidence level (application reliability) will be higher


- When writing tests ALWAYS consider
    - The complexity of the application's code
    - Time and resources available

    - To come up with a suite of tests that provide the most value
