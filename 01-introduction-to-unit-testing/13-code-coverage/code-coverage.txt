Code Coverage
-------------
- To determine how much of the production code is covered with tests
    - In order to identify areas that are NOT yet tested
    

- How to ask Vitest to measure an application or project's code Coverage
    - Open the "package.json" file
    - In the "scripts" section, add a new line

        "coverage": "vitest run --coverage"

    - Save changes


- To run Vitest's code coverage feature
    - Open the terminal, execute:

        npm run coverage

    - NOTE: First time run, npm will ask to install code coverage tool
        - Reply "Y" to proceed with the installation

    - Run the CLI command again
        - Returns a tabled report in the terminal
            - A folder "coverage" will also be created
        
        - EXCLUDE the "coverage" folder from the local repository
            - Open the file ".gitignore"
            - Under the line "# Dependency directories"
            - Add the "coverage/"
            - Then save changes


- To view code coverage in the browser
    - Inside the folder "coverage"
        - Open the file "index.html" in the Live Server or the default browser
        - Loads the generated report in the browser


- In the ideal world, we should aim for 100% code coverage
    - Be pragmatic
        - Find a balance between delivering features & writing tests

    - Remember the job of a software engineer is to solve problems
    - 100% code coverage !== Bug-Free Code
