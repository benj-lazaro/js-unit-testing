What is Unit Testing?
---------------------
- It is a form of automated testing where code is written to test if an app works as expected
    - It offers a faster way of testing than manual testing

    - The codebase consists of two types of code
        - Application code (production)
        - Test code (tests)

    - Tests are run everytime changes in the code are made

    - It is an investment in software quality
    
    - Write tests that are maintainable, robust and trustworthy


- Unit test benefits
    - Detects (and fix) bugs early
        - The later a bug is fix, the most costly it is for a business
        - The cost of a bug
            - Requirements  = 1x
            - Design        = 3x
            - Coding        = 7x
            - Testing       = 15x
            - Deployment    = 30x ... 100x

    - Facilitates refactoring
        - Refactoring is changing the code structure without changing its behavior / functionality
            - e.g. Moving a few lines of code into a function

    - Improves code quality
        - Encourages to consider various test & error conditions = robust & reliable code

    - Documentation
        - Serves as documentation as how a function should / expected to behave 
        - Help other developers in maintaining the codebase


- Mosh Hamedani's opinions on unit testing
    - Be pragmantic
        - New proejcts are NOT the best candidate for unit testing
            - Requirements rapidly chnage and tests break
            - Ends up spending more time fixing broken tests

        - Stable project that are established and have features with stable requirements
            - Cover critical modules with tests
            - Change and refactor with confidence
