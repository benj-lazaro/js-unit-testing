Setting Up Vitest
-----------------
- To install Vitest on the starter project
    - Open a terminal window within the start project's folder


    - Use NPM to install the latest Vitest as a "development dependency"
        - To prevent test tools from being deployed with the application

        npm i -D vitest


    - Open the "package.json" file
        - Look for the key "scripts" 
        - Update its contents by adding the following key-value pair 

        "test": "vitest"

        - This ensures that running "npm test" or "npm t"
            - Vitest will be called and execute the test(s)
