Positive and Negative Testing
-----------------------------
- Positive testing 
    - Ensures that an application works correctly under normal conditions


- Negative testing
    - Checks how well an application handles unexpected or incorrect input


- The advantage of using Vitest's coverage tool (i.e. "npm run coverage")
    - It visually displays what parts of the application's code that has NOT been tested yet
    - Open the "index.html" located within the "coverage" folder using the default browser
    - The untested code is/are highlighted in pink
