Setup and Teardown
------------------
- Sometimes it is necessary to create / setup a consistent environment before running a test
    - Then clean up any resources or state after executing a test 


- Setup includes importing the following functions from Vitest
    - beforeEach()  = calls this function before each test case
    - beforeAll()   = calls this function before ALL test cases
    - afterEach()   = calls this function after each test case
    - afterAll()    = calls this function after ALL test cases

    - NOTE: the order on how the function(s) are called does NOT matter
