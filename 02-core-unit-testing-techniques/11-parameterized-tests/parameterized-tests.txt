Parameterized Tests
-------------------
- Are a way to run the same test multiple times with different sets of input data
    - Also somtimes called Data Driven tests


- This is particularly useful when the testing logic is a bit more complicated
    - Wherein each test case may have multiple lines
    - Lines that are similar BUT defer in the values being tested
    - Removes the need of clever wording for each test case


- Implemented by calling the .each() method of the it() function
    - Passes an array of objects (containing data to be tested) as an argument value
    
    - Followed by the pair of parenthesis of the it() function that accepts two (2) arguments
        - 1st argument  = string value describing the expected behavior (test case)
        - 2nd argument  = arrow function with the objects in the array as argument values
                          calls the expect() function & .toBe() method (data set)
