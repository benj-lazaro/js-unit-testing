Test Driven Development
-----------------------
- Two ways of writing tests
    - Code First
        - Write the application code first
        - Then cover with tests

    - Test First
        - Write tests
        - Then produce the application code
        - This is also referred as Test-Drive Development (TDD)


- Test-Driven Development (TDD) is a way of building software
    - It follows a simple 3-steps cycle
        - Start by writing a failing test
        - Write just enough app code to make the test pass
        - Refactor if necessary

    - It produces code that is 100% covered by tests
    
    - It prevents from over-engineering solutions

    - It can be difficult
        - For 1st time learners of TDD
        - For complex applications  

    - It is NOT a silver bullet
        - As a philosophy is great
        - BUT it does NOT mean that it should ALWAYS write tests using this approach
        - There is NO "one-size-fits-all" in software engineering
