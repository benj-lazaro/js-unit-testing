Choosing a Testing Framework
----------------------------
- A test runner is needed in order to execute the (unit) tests
    - To do is a Testing Framework will be needed

    - Typically includes
        - Test Runner           = Executing tests
        - Assertion Libraries   = Checks if code behaves as expected
        - Mocking Tools         = Replaces modules with fakes to simulate different scenarios
        - Coverage Tools        = Measures how much of the code is tested


- Popular Testing Frameworks
    - Jest      
        - It is widely adopted and used in many projects
        - It is an older Framework
        - It has an experimental support for ECMAScripts Modules

    - Mocha
    - Jasmine

    - Vitest
        - New framework designed for modern JavaScript
        - It has the same features and almost identical API of Jest
        - It supports ECMAScripts Modules, TypeScript and JSX (React)
        - Lessons learned is directly applicable to Jest

    - Cypress
    - Playwright
